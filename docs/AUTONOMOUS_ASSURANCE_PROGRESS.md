# Autonomous Assurance Progress Ledger

**Purpose:** authoritative handoff so future work resumes from repository evidence and does not repeat completed analysis or implementation.

## Resume rule

Before starting new autonomous-assurance work:

1. read `content/assurance/progress.json`;
2. verify current `main`;
3. compare current repository state with the recorded merge commits;
4. continue from `currentWork.nextSteps`;
5. update both progress files after every merged implementation slice.

Do **not** restart from chat memory when repository evidence exists.

## Current authoritative state

- Main at start of this slice: `b8da6dcfd154df32082157f26ebd084944bc01b9`
- Roadmap: `docs/AUTONOMOUS_ASSURANCE_PLAN.md`
- Current branch: `codex/unit1-autonomous-certification`
- Current objective: repair and deterministically certify A1 Unit 1 (`01-introductions`).

## Completed — do not repeat

### PR #82 — autonomous assurance foundation

Merged as `6e6a44bf74c251615f21bc70939873ea54b059f9`.

Implemented:

- Gate 0 machine-readable provenance;
- explicit UNVERIFIED legal state for the Oxford-derived source;
- fail-closed assurance states;
- machine-assurance record schema;
- deterministic A1 content audit;
- unit tests and repository commands;
- autonomous-assurance roadmap/status documentation.

### PR #83 — deterministic assurance ratchet

Merged as `b8da6dcfd154df32082157f26ebd084944bc01b9`.

Implemented:

- measured deterministic-defect baseline;
- CI no-regression ratchet;
- existing debt may temporarily remain, but measured defect classes may not increase.

## Unit 1 measured baseline

Unit: `01-introductions` — 20 entries / 20 senses.

| Finding | Count |
|---|---:|
| Grammar notes without Persian explanation | 24 |
| Senses below the 3-example target | 20 |
| Identical wrong/right Persian translations | 17 |
| Required usage notes missing | 7 |
| Missing `wrongFa` | 0 |
| Missing `rightFa` | 0 |

This diagnosis is already complete. Do not repeat it unless Unit 1 source content changes.

## Known blocker

Gate 0 remains **BLOCKED**. The Oxford-derived workbook is still `UNVERIFIED`. Nothing in later content work may silently convert that state to cleared.

## Repository hygiene

Draft PR #75 predates the current autonomous-assurance main and must not be used as the base for new work. Reassess or close it separately; do not duplicate its old workflow in new branches.

## Current next actions

1. Repair Unit 1 grammar-note Persian.
2. Add pedagogically distinct third examples where required.
3. Repair identical wrong/right Persian mistake translations.
4. Add usage guidance where the deterministic rule requires it.
5. Add a Unit 1 zero-defect gate.
6. Rebuild and commit derived learning artifacts.
7. Pass generated-content consistency, `validate:data`, typecheck, lint, unit tests, production build, Playwright and Workers build contract.
8. Merge.
9. Update this ledger with the merge commit and the next unrepeated objective.
